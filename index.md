# Short bio 

Filip Tronarp received a Master of Science degree in Engineering Mathematics from Lund University, Lund, Sweden in 2016,  
and a Doctor of Science (tech) degree in Automation, Systems and Control Engineering, Aalto University, Finland, 2020. 
Afterwards he worked as a post-doctoral researcher with the [Methods of Machine Learning](https://uni-tuebingen.de/fakultaeten/mathematisch-naturwissenschaftliche-fakultaet/fachbereiche/informatik/lehrstuehle/methoden-des-maschinellen-lernens/start/) group at University of TÃ¼bingen, before receiving his Assistant Professorship appointment with the [Centre for Mathematical Sciences](https://www.maths.lu.se/english/) at Lund University. 
His research interest pertains to modelling and inference in stochastic systems, and applications thereof.  

# Research agenda 

My research agenda broadly falls under the category of statistical machine learning, 
with a clear focus on dynamical systems. Here are some of the topics I am currently examining:   

* Model non-parametrics for dynamical systems. 

* Approximate inference in high-dimensional systems. 

* [Probabilistic numerics](https://www.probabilistic-numerics.org/).
